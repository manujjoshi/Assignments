1. Perform the required Feature Engineering (Feature Selection using RFE, Feature Transformation, etc.)

2. Rebuild the models (Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, DT, RF, Gradient Boosting, AdaBoosting etc.)

3. Compare the model (With Feature Engineering) Performance with previous model (Without Feature Engineering)
